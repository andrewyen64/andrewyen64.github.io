            Hello there, I am Andrew Yen. I love dogs, pizza and most of all video games.
            My favorite type of video games are JRPGs (Japanese role-playing games), 
            mystery visual novels, and platformers.
            I have been really into Animal Crossing New Horizons lately and have also 
            been getting back into Super Smash Bros Ultimate. As a gamer, I hope to somehow 
            utilize this skillset from gaming to make some grade A websites in the future.
