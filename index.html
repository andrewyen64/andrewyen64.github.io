                Hello there and welcome! 
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is Andrew Yen. Currently a student at the Coding Bootcamp at UCR 
                Extension for Full Stack Web Development I love dogs, sushi and most of 
                all video games.
                My favorite types of video games are JRPGs (Japanese role-playing games), 
                visual novels, and platformers.
                I've been playing tons of Animal Crossing New Horizons lately and have also 
                been getting back into Super Smash Bros Ultimate. As a veteran gamer who has seen 
                all sorts of great and messy UIs, I hope to create clean and appealing websites 
                in the future.
